==========
mclauncher
==========
A fully fledged launcher for Minecraft. Made in python, and supports almost all features of the official launcher. Not
tested on Windows.

Usage
-----

Install
~~~~~~~
Install ``mclauncher`` using your favorite flavor of the pip package manager.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mclauncher

Running
~~~~~~~
Use the help command to see a list of available commands. Pip should have added the ``mclauncher`` package to
PATH, so you should be able to simply run ``mclauncher`` in your terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    mclauncher -h

If that doesn't work, a consistent fallback is to run ``mclauncher`` using your favorite flavor of the python command.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m mclauncher -h
